handset-utils is a little application designed to query either a SQLite database or FonoAPI and return a handset object. The primary use case is generating test data for external applications using somewhat realistic information.

UPDATE
It appears that this application's primary dependency (The FonoAPI) has ceased its precense online, causing this utility to be largely redundant. I will leave it up, but unfortunately it is unlikely to be of much use going forward.
